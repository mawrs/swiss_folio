                            <!-- Introduction -->
                            <div class="case-study-section mb-5">
                                <h4>A New Experience</h4>
                                <p>In 2021, Facebook revealed a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2752670058165459?id=418112142508425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new Pages experience</a> to enhance how businesses and public figures can connect with their audiences.</p>
                                <p>As a Product Designer on the Discovery & Distribution team, I had the privilege of working on two features to help public figures stay connected with their audiences:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Admin Notifications Center:</strong> An entry point to custom settings, tabs, and highlights to allow admins of public figure accounts to have more control over their notifications and make it easier to find.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Top Fans:</strong> An incentive to make it easier for fans to stand out when engaging with public figure content.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>These features were sketched, prototyped, and tested with the help of other Designers, UX Researchers, Engineers, PMs, and a Product Design Manager who oversaw the work our team was completing.</p>
                            </div>

                            <!-- Initial Research -->
                            <div class="case-study-section mb-5">
                                <h4>Understanding Previous Efforts</h4>
                                <p>Immediately after joining the team, I dove into previous research projects that were conducted around public figures to better understand the needs of the admins and audiences.</p>
                                <p>In doing so, I found research projects from 2019 around features for Facebook Stories. Some of those features were launched, and others were never shipped. I talked to several designers who had worked on those previous efforts and gained a better understanding as to why we were now pushing for admin controls and specific features for the fans.</p>
                            </div>

                            <!-- Admin Notifications Center -->
                            <div class="case-study-section mb-5">
                                <h4>Admin Notifications Center</h4>
                                <p>My research partner had previously conducted interviews and with public figure admins to better understand their needs, and one area of opportunity was designing a better way for admins to manage their notifications.</p>
                                <p>Public figure accounts received upwards of 20,000 notifications daily, so I collaborated with my design partner to brainstorm potential solutions that would improve the quality of life for the admins by providing an all-in-one command center with custom settings, tabs, and highlights designed for quicker access.</p>
                                <p>With an understanding of the current layout of notifications, I sketched potential design layouts that included several of the talking points from the user interviews.</p>

                                <p>Using the interview responses as my guide, I came up with a few questions to keep in mind as I explored several layouts:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Which notification types should be prioritized? Likes, Comments, etc?</li>
                                    <li>Should admins be able to configure the tabs that are shown?</li>
                                    <li>Should there be scrolling tabs off the screen?</li>
                                    <li>What if another public figure reacts to the post?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I reached out to one of our engineers and presented these sketches as a way to call out early technical risks or rabbit holes we may encounter with this solution. One potential risks we discussed was the introduction of "highlights" as a way to prioritize important notifications coming from other public figures, and the technical feasiblity of something like this.</p>
                                <p>Utilizing a robust design system such as FDS proved to be a bit of a challenge considering the strict rules put in place by Facebook's design system team. Fortunately, they were very responsive and pointed me to the correct components to use for my designs. They even pointed me to one of Facebook's design principles, which is to "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/693790757917796/?_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduce, reuse, don't redesign</a></p>
                                <p>I ended up with six variants of this new notifications center and presented them to my design team over a period of two weeks. I also communicated with my research partner to understand if they had a particular research method in mind to test the effectiveness of the new design.
                                <p>Thanks to my team's feedback, I was able to iterate on the design and land on a final concept that was later tested on users.</p>

                                <h4>Choosing a Research Method</h4>
                                <p>Seeing that we were looking to compare the revamped notifications center against the old one, we agreed upon standard quantitative A/B testing on several segments of public figure accounts. The segments to test on were ultimately decided by our PM and research team. On top of the quantitative tests, I suggested an additional qualitative test to dig deeper into the specific areas of the feature that could be reshaped, but received pushback due to the lack of bandwith from researchers who had to sit in those interviews.</p>
                                <p>We collaborated on the research project script to make sure we were asking the right questions and would be able to draw conclusions that tied back to our team goals of improving the quality of life for admins through task efficiency.</p>

                                <p>With Facebook's robust design system, documenting the components used in the new notifications center was straightforward, especially with the help I received from the design system team.</p>
                                <p> My main goal during the handoff was to provide extremely detailed documentation and any edge cases they should be aware of. Once in the hands of the developers, I made myself available at all times to answer further questions they had about the design.</p>

                                <h4>Top Fans</h4>
                                <p>As another way of connecting public figures and their audiences, our team also explored a previous research project that was conducted around Top Fans, which aimed at providing incentives to dedicated followers of public figures. This initiative aimed to gamify the experience and make it easier to stand out among other fans.</p>
                                <p>Previous research had shown that fans were more likely to engage with public figures if they were recognized for their loyalty. I began working closely with the PM to define what success looked like for this feature, and the constraints of the visual design for this feature.</p>
                                <p>To understand the visual constraints of the feature, I reached out to the visual design team and asked them to show me the current visual language for badges. This allowed me to build the feature in a way that felt cohesive with the rest of the Facebook Design System.</p>

                                <p>After crafting several versions of the feature and presenting them to the design team, I landed on a simple icon next to the fan's name to not obstruct the content of the post. I prototyped an end-to-end experience in Figma to serve as our initial concept test to test engagement and adoption of this new feature.</p>
                                <p>Working closely with our researcher, we outlined the flow of the test and crafted a handful of questions for the interview. For this particular test, we added both qualitative and quantitative questions that would allow us to synthesize more data in the future.</p>

                                <p>In 2020, Square experienced a significant increase in phishing scams via email, resulting in millions of dollars lost by Square sellers who were unable to recover their funds.</p>
                                <p>This prompted Square to double down on their fraud prevention efforts, including an overhaul of their emailing templates.</p>

                                <p>As an external hire joining the Risk team, I had several one-on-ones with cross-functional team members during my first week and was made aware of a recent survey that stated 62% out of 1,400 Square sellers had difficulty distinguishing legitimate Square emails from scams due to inconsistent branding and design.</p>
                                <p>We also knew the lack of confidence from Square sellers was due to inconsistent branding and design because previous interviews were conducted and four out of the five (80%) sellers interviewed were unable to confidently distinguish between a phishing email and a real one. The lone seller was able to distinguish between the two because she had recently received a real Square email and was able to recall the design.</p>

                                <p>In an effort to increase confidence among sellers and reduce the number of scams, we decided to overhaul the email templates used by Square and create a more unified email design system that would be recognizable to all readers, internally and externally.</p>
                                <p>I had the unique opportunity of owning parts of the new email design system, which was a pseudo design system in an effort to reach proper design standardization. These efforts included working with the product owner to define the scope of the project and working with the UX Writer to understand the brand guidelines. Not to mention my weekly check-ins with fellow Product Designers, UX Researchers, and the Product Design Manager.</p>

                                <p>After conducting qualitative usability tests with five users, we observed a 25% improvement in their ability to identify legitimate Square emails. Based on this feedback, my design partner and I refined the designs further, particularly focusing on creating consistent body, header, and footer components that could be highly modular across all departments.</p>
                                <p>The goal was now to conduct a large-scale survey to test the new emails against the original emails, which had a 38% success rate.</p>

                                <p>To properly serve a large-scale organization like Square, we needed to create constraints to the email layout to ensure consistency across the company.</p>
                                <p>With the help of my design partner and PM, we dissected the general makeup of each email type and were able to distill the vast majority of the emails down to a handful of modular components, effectively creating a mini design system for email layout.</p>
                                <p>We created all the necessary designs and components using Figma, and uploaded the HTML direclty into Contenful for faster implementation.</p>

                                <p>The results of our efforts were gradual, and six months after the launch of our new email designs we starting seeing the fruits of our labor:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Seller Confidence Soared:</strong> Going back to our original benchmark, we observed an 82% confidence score in sellers identifying legitimate Square emails, a 22% increase compared to the previous survey results. This boost in trust is invaluable for maintaining strong, long-term relationships with our sellers.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Phishing Attempts Plummeted:</strong> We saw a 12.5% decrease in reported phishing attempts, a clear indication that our standardized design was making it easier for sellers to identify legitimate Square communications.</li>

                                <h4>The Power of Design in Security</h4>
                                <p>This project taught me many valuable lessons about the role of design in security. By creating a consistent, easily recognizable email design, we were able to significantly enhance our sellers' ability to identify legitimate Square communications, and in turn protect them from financial loss.</p>
                                <p>If I had stayed on the team longer, I would have loved to explore exactly why the new emails worked so well. Were the fraudsters really deterred by the new design? Did they no longer pursue Square sellers after the COVID spike?</p>
                                <p>Overall, I'm proud of the work we did and the impact we had on Square's email security.</p>

                                <h4>End of Sprint Week</h4>
                                <p>On the fifth and final day of our design sprint, we conducted user testing sessions with five policy holders and three Slide executives. This step was crucial in validating our prototype and gathering real-world feedback. We set up two rooms: one for interviews and another for the sprint team to observe.</p>
                                
                                <p>As the lead designer, I prepared our prototype and crafted some interview questions to guide the sessions. We carefully observed user interactions, paying attention to both verbal and non-verbal cues. This process provided invaluable insights into the effectiveness of our claims process, helping us identify strengths and areas for improvement. The immediate feedback allowed us to quickly assess which ideas worked, which didn't, and informed our next steps for refining the product.</p>

                                <div class="project-images mb-4">

                                <p>This was the first in-person design sprint I conducted in person, and it was a nerve-wracking yet highly rewarding experience. Everyone came out of that room extremely satisfied with the results of the sprint, and Slide even agreed to sign an additional 3-month contract to get the prototype into production.</p>

                                <h4>3-Month Product Development Phase</h4>
                                <p>Following the sprint, I went back to managing my design team, but I continued to work closely with the Slide team to refine the product.</p>
                                
                                <p>This 3-month phase included:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Iterative Design Refinement:</strong> Weekly design reviews, continuous iteration based on user feedback, and optimization of user flows.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Development of Comprehensive Design System:</strong> Continuing to create a scalable design system using Tailwind CSS, including a component library and documented guidelines.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cross-functional Collaboration and Testing:</strong> Working closely with engineering, product, and design teams to conducted regular user testing and A/B testing to optimize the claims process.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Performance, Accessibility, and Compliance:</strong> Ensuring fast load times, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, and adherence to insurance industry regulations while maintaining a user-friendly interface.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The results of our efforts were transformative:</p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> We dramatically reduced the average time to complete a claim with Slidefrom 20 minutes to just 8 minutes - a 60% improvement that significantly eased user frustration.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reduced Support Needs:</strong> Most important of all, we saw a 47% decrease in customer support calls related to the claim process. This not only indicated a more self-serviceable system but also translated to significant operational savings for Slide.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The success of this sprint and development phase demonstrated the critical role of communicating effectively with stakeholders to truly understand the needs of the business, and the most practical solution for the users. As lead designer, I'm proud to have guided this project from concept to implementation, delivering tangible results that positively impacted both users and the business.</p>
                                
                                <p>Slide's new and improved claims process has positioned them to be one of the top insurance companies in Florida. In fact, Slide <a href="https://www.slideinsurance.com/press-release/slide-acquires-renewal-rights-for-farmers-insurance-homeowners-policies-in-florida" target="_blank">recently acquired the renewal rights for Farmers Insurance</a> homeowners policies in the state. This added an additional 86,000 policy holders to their platform.</p>
